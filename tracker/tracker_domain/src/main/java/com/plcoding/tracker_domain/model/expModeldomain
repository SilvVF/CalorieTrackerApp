Domain level models that represent some data layer data class

These are used to separate things like entities and json response DTOs

The domain layer classes can use other types of objects to hold the data
such as sealed classes - more than just primitives the api and db don't parse this


MAPPER CLASSES ARE LOCATED IN THE TRACKER DATA MODULE
- maps these domain models to data layer entities and response objects
