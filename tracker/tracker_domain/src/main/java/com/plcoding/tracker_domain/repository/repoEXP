Repository contains all of the function we need to be performed but does not implement
the implementation happens in the data layer and is not exposed when calling the
function from the repository

the implementation can be found in the data layer

Reason for using this is it abstracts the implementation from the caller
also allows for easier testing by creating fake implementations that just feed back
set data

also contains a wrapper class containing a reference to all of the use cases to make the
constructor of the viewModel less messy when injecting the use cases as dependencies
